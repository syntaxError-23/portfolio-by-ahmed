## About The Project

I have created a portfolio page to showcase some of the projects I have worked on in my brief experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Usage

The page is composed of 4 sections:

1. Navigation bar
2. Work
3. About me 
4. Contact me


The CSS includes a media query which changes the way the webpage is rendered on screens with a width of 720px or smaller.

This screenshot below shows what the webpage first looks like when you access it on larger screens.

<img src="./assets/images/ss-1.png" alt="webpage when first opened">

<br>

This next screenshot shows what the webpage looks when you first access it on smaller screens.

<img src="./assets/images/ss-2.png" alt="webpage when first opened on smaller screens">

<br>

The navigation bar contains links to the various sections of the page. The work section also contains links to the projects mentioned above. I have styled these links (a tags) to respond when he cursor is hovering above them as shown in the screenshots below.

<img src="./assets/images/ss-nav.png" alt="Navigation links in hover state">

<img src="./assets/images/ss-overlay.png" alt="Portfolio links in hover state">

## Where to find the project

The project was deployed via github pages. You can find it <a href="https://syntaxerror-23.github.io/portfolio-by-ahmed/">here</a>

If that link doesn't work, use the following url: https://syntaxerror-23.github.io/portfolio-by-ahmed/
